# Linux Application Configuration for Azure

## Overview

This template repository contains the Terraform configurations for deploying and managing multiple Linux-based applications on Azure. It is designed to showcase best practices in infrastructure as code (IaC) for managing cloud resources, making it an ideal reference for companies interested in cloud infrastructure, automation, and efficient cloud resource management.

## Features

- **YAML Configuration**: List and manage application specifications such as name, operating system, and SKU using YAML files.
- **Modular Terraform Setup**: Leverage local values and for-each loops within Terraform to dynamically create resources based on YAML-defined apps.
- **Resource Grouping**: Setup and configuration of Azure resource groups tailored for hosting Linux applications in the Canada Central region.
- **Service Plans and Web Apps**: Automated deployment of Azure service plans and Linux web apps with configuration details specified in YAML.

## Potential Use Cases

This project is suitable for businesses that require:
- Scalable infrastructure setups using infrastructure as code (IaC).
- Cloud deployments with a focus on automation and minimal manual intervention.
- Education and demonstration of Terraform capabilities in a cloud environment.
